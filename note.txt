Docker 

docker compose up
#to start docker compose (for default docker-composer.yml)
When you run docker-compose up without the -d flag, it starts the services in the foreground, and you see the logs of each service in your terminal.
It's useful for debugging, monitoring, and seeing real-time logs from your services.
If you terminate the command (e.g., by pressing Ctrl+C), it will stop the running services.




docker-compose up -d
When you run docker-compose up -d, it starts the services in the background (detached mode), and you don't see the logs in your terminal.
It's typically used in production or when you want to run your services in the background without tying up your terminal.
If you terminate your terminal session, the services will keep running.
 If you use docker-compose up -d, you can still view the logs later using docker-compose logs.

Remember that both commands (docker-compose up -d,  docker-compose up) will read your docker-compose.yml file and start the defined services along with any associated configurations.
